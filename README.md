# voice-command-simulator# 

A Python GUI project that uses **speech recognition** and **text-to-speech** to control a moving object on the screen by voice commands like  
 “move forward"
 “turn left”  
 “turn right”  
 “stop”

This project was built to explore how speech and GUI can work together in Python.

## Features
- Move an on-screen rectangle forward, backward, left, or right with your voice
- Voice feedback: the app speaks out what it’s doing
- Built with:
  - `tkinter` (GUI)
  - `speech_recognition` (voice commands)
  - `pyttsx3` (text-to-speech)
  - 
## Installation

# Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed.

Then install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3

# how to run the project
python voice_controlled_simulator.py
